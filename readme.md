INSTAGRAM BLOCK
===========

This is a very simple module that integrates with Instagram and creates a block containing your most recent instagram posts.

Each block's configuration page lets you choose how many posts and what size they should appear in the block. The images are individually exposed to the drupal theme layer, so developers have access to an all of the variables provided by the instagram api should they choose to extent the block. For more informations see the instagram developer pages: http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/users/#get_users_media_recent

This module depends on php curl commands to parse the information from instagram and thus has a dependency on php5-curl.

I also provide an authorisation callback to get the users instagram details through a site that I host (http://instagram.yanniboi.com).

The heavy lifting for this module was done by Nick from Blueprint Interactive, so kudos to him.
